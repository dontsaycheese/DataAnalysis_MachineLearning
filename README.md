# Employee Attrition Prediction using Classification Models
In this project I have used the 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance' dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of 1470 records and 35 data columns. Attrition is the dependent variable in this dataset (whether an employee will leave the organisation after a year in the organisation) This may be dependent on the independent variables such as Performance Rate, Job Satisfaction, Income, Distance from Home etc. 

The project includes:
1. Feature Selection
2. Feature Exploration
3. Cleaning and Formatting data
5. Splitting dataset (train and test)
6. Visualisation
7. Generated 3 different classifiers:
a. Decision Tree (86% accuracy)
b. Support Vector Machine (87% accuracy)
c. KNN Classifier (90% aacuracy)
*Figures mentioned in the brackets are the maximum accuracy provided by the classifiers in predicting 'Attrition'.
